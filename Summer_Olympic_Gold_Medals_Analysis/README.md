# Summer Olympic Gold Medal Analysis (1976-2008)

This repository contains the code and analysis for a comprehensive data project focused on Summer Olympic gold medals spanning the years 1976 to 2008. 
The project was conducted using Google Colab, utilizing Python's data analysis libraries to explore and visualize trends related to gold medals, athlete dominance, gender distribution, and event classification.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this analysis were:

1. To explore the distribution of gold medals among different countries.
2. To examine the distribution of gold medals based on gender.
3. To identify and visualize the dominating athletes over the specified timeline.
4. To analyze the distribution of gold medals by sport and event for each year.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project contains detailed information about the gold medals awarded in various Summer Olympic events from 1976 to 2008. 
The data includes attributes such as City, Year, Sport, Discipline, Event, Athlete, Gender, Country_Code, Country, Event_gender, Medal.

## Analysis and Visualizations

### 1. Gold Medal Distribution by Country:
To understand which countries dominated the gold medal count during the specified years, a bar graph was created showcasing the top countries based on the number of gold medals won. The x-axis represents the countries, while the y-axis represents the count of gold medals.

### 2. Gold Medal Distribution by Gender:
A breakdown of gold medals by gender was also analyzed and visualized. A bar graph was generated to illustrate the distribution of gold medals among male and female athletes. This visualization provides insights into the gender dynamics of gold medal achievements.

### 3. Gold Medal Distribution by Athlete, Sport, and Event (Year-wise):
An in-depth analysis was conducted to explore the trends in gold medal distribution across athletes, sports, and events for each individual year. This involved categorizing the data by year and creating visualizations to showcase the distribution of gold medals in different categories. The resulting line graphs and bar charts offer insights into the evolving landscape of Olympic achievements over time.

### 4. Dominating Athletes Analysis:
To recognize the athletes who dominated the Olympic events, an analysis was conducted to identify individuals with the most gold medals across the specified years. This information was then used to create a bar graph highlighting these dominating athletes and their gold medal counts.
